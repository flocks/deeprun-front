Frontend code of www.deeprun.poker app.

Deeprun is a poker equities calculator.
The frontend is build with ReactJS/Redux with webpack. It is tested with jest and enzyme.

I'm currently building the backend in Haskell with the micro framework Scotty. That's the reason why the equities displayed in the app are for now hardcoded and fake.
